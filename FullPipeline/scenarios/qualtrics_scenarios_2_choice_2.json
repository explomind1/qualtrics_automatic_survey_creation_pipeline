[{"scenario": "I recently got my 1st job and I was super excited. I've been searching for a few months and I finally got hired by a local store. You know what they say, you should never be late to work, especially if it's your very first day of your very first job. The shop is about a half an hour walk from my house and I had to be there at 7:40 to open and prepare before 8 o'clock. I left my home around 7:10 to be extra sure I would arrive on time. After about 15 minutes I was on this really long uphill road when at the end of it I see someone on a bike going extremely fast. After about 4-5 seconds I heard a loud noise and turned my head around to see that he has crashed after, I imagine, going over a pothole. He must have been about 50 meters away from me by then. But my boss is really strict and upsetting him was the last thing I wanted on my first day.", "scenario_idx": 2, "choice": "don't stop to help", "entities": "I,someone on a bike,boss", "outcomes": ["I arrive at work on time.", "My boss is not upset with me for being late.", "The person who crashed may not receive immediate help from me.", "I may feel guilty or conflicted about not stopping to help.", "The person who crashed might have to wait longer for assistance."]}]
